\title{Return the estimated mixture proportions}
\usage{
get_estimated_pi(m, dimension = c("cov", "grid", "all"))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the mash result}

\item{dimension}{indicates whether you want the mixture proportions for the covariances, grid, or all}
}
\value{
a named vector containing the estimated mixture proportions.
}
\description{
Return the estimated mixture proportions
}
\details{
If the fit was done with `usepointmass=TRUE` then the
first element of the returned vector will correspond to the null,
and the remaining elements to the non-null covariance matrices.
Suppose the fit was done with $K$ covariances and a grid of length
$L$. If `dimension=cov` then the returned vector will be of length
$K$ (or $K+1$ if `usepointmass=TRUE`).  If `dimension=grid` then
the returned vector will be of length $L$ (or $L+1$).  If
`dimension=all` then the returned vector will be of length $LK$ (or
$LK+1$). The names of the vector will be informative for which
combination each element corresponds to.
