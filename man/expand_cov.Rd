\title{Create expanded list of covariance matrices expanded by grid}
\usage{
expand_cov(Ulist, grid, usepointmass = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ulist}{a list of covarance matrices}

\item{grid}{a grid of scalar values by which the covariance
matrices are to be sc}

\item{usepointmass}{if TRUE adds a point mass at 0 (null component)
to the list}
}
\value{
This takes the covariance matrices in Ulist and multiplies
them by the grid values If usepointmass is TRUE then it adds a null
component.
