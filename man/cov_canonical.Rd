\title{Compute a list of canonical covariance matrices}
\usage{
cov_canonical(
  data,
  cov_methods = c("identity", "singletons", "equal_effects", "simple_het")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a mash data object, eg as created by \code{mash_set_data}}

\item{cov_methods}{a vector of strings indicating the matrices to
be used: "identity" for the identity (effects are independent among
conditions); "singletons" for the set of matrices with just one
non-zero entry \eqn{x_{jj} = 1, j = 1,...,R}; (effect specific to
condition j); "equal_effects" for the matrix of all 1s (effects are
equal among conditions); "simple_het" for a set of matrices with 1s
on the diagonal and all off-diagonal elements equal to 0.25, 0.5 or
0.75; see \code{cov_simple_het} for details; (effects are
correlated among conditions).}
}
\value{
a list of covariance matrices
}
\description{
Compute a list of canonical covariance matrices
}
\details{
The default is that this function computes covariance matrices corresponding
to the "bmalite" models.

\examples{
data = mash_set_data(Bhat = cbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)), Shat = cbind(c(1,1),c(1,1)))
 cov_canonical(data)
 cov_canonical(data,"singletons")
 cov_canonical(data,c("id","sing")) # can use partial matching of names
